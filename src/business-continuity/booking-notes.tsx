                For all cash bookings, it is crucial to count and verify the
                full payment from the guest before clicking the "Confirm
                Booking" button. This prevents financial discrepancies and
                ensures the booking is logged correctly in the system.

                Before handing over room keys, ask the guest for their booking
                confirmation (on their printed tickets or on their device).
                Match the booking code and guest name with the details in the
                system to ensure the correct person is checking into the correct
                room.

                When processing a mobile payment, double-check the total amount
                displayed on the confirmation screen. Once the payment request
                is sent to the customer's mobile provider, it cannot be easily
                altered.

                Pay close attention to any "Service Notes" or "Special Requests"
                entered during the booking process. These contain important
                guest information (e.g., allergies, late check-in, pet
                information) that is vital for providing good service.
